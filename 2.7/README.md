Python Docker image
===================

This repository contains the source for building various versions of
the Python application as a reproducible Docker image using
[source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image).
Users can choose between RHEL and CentOS based builder images.
The resulting image can be run using [Docker](http://docker.io).


Usage
---------------------
To build the iPython Notebook application using standalone 
[S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) and then run the
resulting image with [Docker](http://docker.io) execute:

*  **For RHEL based image**
    ```
    $ s2i build https://github.com/grafuls/sti-ipython-nb.git --context-dir=2.7 openshift/ipython-27-rhel7 ipython-nb-app
    $ docker run --net=host ipython-nb-app
    ```

*  **For CentOS based image**
    ```
    $ s2i build https://github.com/grafuls/sti-ipython-nb.git --context-dir=2.7 openshift/python-27-centos7 ipython-nb-app
    $ docker run --net=host ipython-nb-app
    ```

**Notice! The images need to be built first!**

**Accessing the application:**
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8888
```
Or via browser at [https://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888)


Repository organization
------------------------
* **`<python-version>`**

    * **Dockerfile**

        CentOS based Dockerfile.

    * **Dockerfile.rhel7**

        RHEL based Dockerfile. In order to perform build or test actions on this
        Dockerfile you need to run the action on a properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    * **`s2i/bin/`**

        This folder contains scripts that are run by [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image):

        *   **assemble**

            Used to install the sources into the location where the application
            will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg. installing
            dependencies, etc.)

        *   **run**

            This script is responsible for running the application by using the
            application web server.

        *   **usage***

            This script prints the usage of this image.

    * **`contrib/`**

        This folder contains a file with commonly used modules.



Source repository layout
------------------------

You do not need to change anything in your existing Python project's repository.
However, if these files exist they will affect the behavior of the build process:

* **requirements.txt**

  List of dependencies to be installed with `pip`. The format is documented
  [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files).


* **setup.py**

  Configures various aspects of the project, including installation of
  dependencies, as documented
  [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#setup-py).
  For most projects, it is sufficient to simply use `requirements.txt`.
